### Hello TA's ###

I'm sorry. 

This will require the dotnet runtime to compile. As I am writing this it does compile on my machine. If you don't want to install the dotnet runtime, I can attach a windows/linux build to the releases (although it won't actually do anything right now lol except give a
not implemented exception for obvious reasons)
